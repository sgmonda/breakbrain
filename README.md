#Breakbrain

Social network to improve mental skills by mean of mini-games

## About Breakbrain

Breakbrain is a complex social network oriented to improve mental skills by mean of multiplayer and single-player mini-games playing. It has been built on top of NodeJS, using MongoDB as persistence system. Breakbrain has been thought to support 3rd-party games integration, so you can be a part of the developing community if you want, allowing other users to play your games. It is awesome, isn't it?

Breakbrain offers you a stats dashboard where you can see your mental skills evolution and compare it with other users one. Furthermore, this social network integrates a recommendation module to tip you about what games you must play (based on your skills) and which players you could follow.

Social aspects are really simple: you can follow other users, to see their evolution and news and play multi-player games against them, and other users can follow you.
